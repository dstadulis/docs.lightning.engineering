## Overview

`LND` ships with a few useful features for debugging, such as a built-in profiler and tunable logging levels. If you need to submit a bug report for `LND`, it may be helpful to capture debug logging and performance data ahead of time.

## Debug Logging

Logging is useful for security and operating purposes. LND logs can typically be found on Linux at `~/.lnd/logs/bitcoin/mainnet/lnd.log`, on macOS at ​​`~/Library/Application Support/Lnd/logs/bitcoin/mainnet` or in their specified location using the`--logdir` flag at startup.

By default, LND will log 10MB worth of its history, and additionally keep three blocks of logs around, compressed with gzip as `lnd.log.<i>.gz` in the same directory.

You can adjust the location of your log files as well their maximum size (in MB) and how many historical log files you expect LND to keep, in your [`lnd.conf`](lnd.conf.md) file.

`logdir=~/.lnd/logs`\
`maxlogfiles=3`\
`maxlogfilesize=10`\
`debuglevel=debug,PEER=info`

Additionally, the debuglevel can be overridden and adjusted without requiring a restart using the command `lncli debuglevel --level=`

The available debug levels are, in order of descending detail: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `critical`, `off`

Example usage:

`lncli debuglevel –-level=debug`

Additionally, the log level can be adjusted for each individual subsystem. A list of the subsystem can also be obtained with the command `lncli debuglevel --show`

Varying debug levels for multiple subsystems can be chained together with commands.

Example usage:

`debuglevel --level=BTCN=trace,LNWL=debug`

## Capturing pprof data with `lnd`

`lnd` has a built-in feature which allows you to capture profiling data at runtime using [pprof](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/pprof/), a profiler for Go. The profiler has negligible performance overhead during normal operations (unless you have explicitly enabled CPU profiling).

To enable this ability, start `lnd` with the `--profile` option using a free port.

```shell
lnd --profile=9736
```

Now, with `lnd` running, you can use the pprof endpoint on port 9736 to collect runtime profiling data. You can fetch this data using `curl` like so:

```shell
curl http://localhost:9736/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1
```
